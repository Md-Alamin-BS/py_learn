## Experiment Summary

### Hypothesis

{Describe the hypothesis being tested as clearly and measurably as possible.}

### Impact

{What is the impact of this hypothesis being proved true? False?}

### Measure of Success

{If the Experiment Family doesn't define what metrics you are using to define success, then what metric(s) are you using to measure success/failure, and what value or range of values would indicate success/failure? Note that the family may define the _how_ - the actual metric(s), and the experiment may define the _what_ - what value for that metric (or what improvement over baseline) would be considered success.}

### Dependencies

{Are there any known dependencies or pre-requisites related to this experiment?}

## Methodology

### Initial Plan

{How do you expect people to execute this experiment?}

### Assumptions and Limitations

{What are the assumptions made for this experiment and how will these assumption limit the results obtained?}

### Data specifications

{In conducting this experiment, are we using the full dataset or subsets (why and how were they created), is there any pre-processing applied (detail it)?, etc}

## Execution

### Execution Details

{In conducting this experiment, how did you deviate from the initial plan, and why? Is there anything we can learn from those deviations that may influence future experiments?}

## Results

### Results Summary

{What were the concrete results of the experiment? How do those results compare to your expectations? Was this a success or a failure?}

### Results References

{If the experiment was executed in a Jupyter Notebook, link to the notebook here. If there are other relevant files (experiment non-notebook code, model checkpoints, debug logs, etc.), link those here as well.}

### [Optional] Additional references

{If there are any other related notebooks/experiments or external references that are relevant for this experiment.}
