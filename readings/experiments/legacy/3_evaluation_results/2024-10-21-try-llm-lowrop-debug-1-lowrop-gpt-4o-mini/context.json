If no tags apply, respond with `no tags`. Stick to the definition for the tag, do not make assumptions beyond the given data.\n\nDefinition of Low Rate of Penetration (lowrop):\n\nThe reasons could be:\n- hard formation like stringers.\n- Worn drill bit.\n- Bad drill bit design.\n- Drilling parameters not optimised.\n\nRate of Penetration (ROP, drilling speed) is considered lowrop if:\n- ROP is below 10 m/hr or 10 m/hr.\nExample: \"ROP = 6 m/hr\" \u2192 Tag as lowrop.\nOR\n- If stringers or hard formations are encountered while drilling, tag with lowrop regardless of ROP values.\nExample 1: Drilled through harder formation in interval 246 m - 248 m \u2192 Tag as lowrop, as hard formations are encountered.\nExample 2: Drilled stringer from 2770-2771 m, ROP is 20 m/hr.  \u2192 Tag as lowrop, as stringers are encountered, even if ROP is above 10 m/hr.\nExample 3: DRLG STRINGERS -> These are drilling stringers, tag as lowrop.\n\nDo not tag as lowrop if the reduction in ROP is intentional, regardless of value or presence of stringers.\nExamples of intentional reductions include: Directional Control, Milling, Logging, Ballooning, Washing, Controlled Drilling, Data Gathering.\n# Example 1: Drilled with reduced ROP to obtain data points \u2192 Do not tag as lowrop.\n# Example 2: Continued to log OOH from 4206 m to 3333 m at 1.5 m/min \u2192 Do not tag as lowrop.\n# Example 3: Observed 0,9 m3/hr ballooning rate. \u2192 Do not tag as lowrop.\n# Example 4: Commenced milling \u2192 Do not tag as lowrop.\nConversion Rules:\n- 1 m/min = 60 m/hr, always perform the conversion if needed.\n- 1 m3/hr = 1 m/hr\n- 1 mph = 1 m/hr\n- 1 mhr = 1 m/hr\nImportant: Ensure the model performs comparisons. Example: If the ROP is 6, it is below 10. If the ROP is 27, it is above 10.\nIf no tags apply, respond with no tags.\n\nOther situations that might occur during drilling: Lost Circulation, Hard Drilling, Wellbore Stability, Stuck Pipe, Well Control, Hole Cleaning, Tight Hole, Boulders, Shallow Gas, Shallow Water, Wellbore Breathing, Pack-Off, Directional Control, High ROP, Downhole Equipment Failure, Wait, Surface Equipment Failure.These situations may or may not occur at the same time with Low Rate of Penetreation.\nBefore you provide the answer, explain the reason for selecting each tag or lack of it. The reason should be supplied at the end, following |debug| separator. Answer template: tag1, tag2, tag3|debug|reason1, reason2, reason3",
