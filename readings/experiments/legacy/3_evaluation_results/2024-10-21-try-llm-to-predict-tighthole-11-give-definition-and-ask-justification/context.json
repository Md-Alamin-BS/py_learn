  "llm_system_prompt": "\nYou will be given a daily drilling report.\nPlease determine whether it describes a \"Tight Hole\" situation.\n\n### Definition of Tight Hole\n\n**Tight Hole** refers to a drilling scenario where there is difficulty in moving the drill string or casing through the wellbore due to increased friction or obstruction.\n\nA Tight Hole scenario generally involves:\n\n1. **Overcoming tight spots**: the tight spots can be minor and easily manageable, but also can require a significant effort from the engineer.\n2. **Difficulty in Movement**: There is resistance or difficulty in moving the drill string, casing, or other equipment through the wellbore. This is often due to tight spots or restrictions.\n3. **Overpull**: An additional force (overpull) is required to move the equipment. This is a key indicator of a tight hole.\n4. **Working the String**: Efforts to work the string, such as jarring or rotating, are often necessary to overcome the tight spots.\n5. **Reaming or Lubricating**: Reaming through tight spots or using lubrication to ease movement is common.\n6. **Difficulty in Movement**: There is resistance or difficulty in moving the drill string, casing, or other equipment through the wellbore. This can result in an increased drag. This is often due to tight spots or restrictions.\n\nIn contrast, scenarios that are not Tight Hole involve:\n\n1. **Equipment Failure**: Issues primarily related to equipment malfunction or failure, such as surface equipment failures or downhole equipment issues.\n2. **Routine Operations**: Normal operations without significant resistance or overpull, such as running in hole or pulling out without difficulty.\n3. **Other Specific Issues**: Situations like stuck pipe, pack-off, or lost circulation that are tagged differently and have distinct characteristics.\n\nOverall, a Tight Hole is characterized by mechanical resistance in the wellbore requiring additional force and effort to overcome, without being primarily due to equipment failure.\n\nOther situations that might occur during drilling: Lost Circulation, Hard Drilling, Wellbore Stability, Stuck Pipe, Well Control, Hole Cleaning, Boulders, Shallow Gas, Shallow Water, Wellbore Breathing, Pack-Off, Directional Control, Low ROP, High ROP, Downhole Equipment Failure, Wait, Surface Equipment Failure.\nThese situations may or may not occur at the same time with Tight Hole, but Tight Hole should not be confused with them.\n\nDrill string can also be called cable or wire.\n\nRespond with 2 lines:\n1. Reason whether the report describes a potential Tight Hole situation.\n2. Write \"tighthole\" if the report describes a potential Tight Hole situation, and \"notag\" otherwise.\n\n## Example report 1\n\nPerform wireline run #5B according to program. When retracting from pre-test station at 4236.8 m experienced stuck tendencies. Stuck on cable, free after pulling with 12170 lbf. Decided to cancel the 3 last remaining pre-tests.   - Completed 54 stations, 9 good pre-tests. Struggled to achieve stable build up when recording pre-tests. - Well static throughout logging operations.\n\n### Expected response 1\n\nThe drill string was stuck, but the engineer managed to release it and pull through without further complications. Because the string was not left stuck in the pipe, this is a Tight Hole scenario, not Stuck Pipe scenario.\ntighthole\n\n## Example report 2\n\nAttempt to pick up off bottom at 1503m due to increase in pump pressure to 210 bar, top drive stalled  out, stuck in hole. Release torque, shut down pump with 4 m3 losses, drill pipe holding 33 bar.  Work jar once at ~110 mt- work string, bleed off pressure to cock jars, work pipe free to 1494m. Begin rotation at 70 rpm and 2.5k ftlbs torque, bring pumps slowly up to 1300 lpm with 118 bar, stall out again.  Reduce pump rate to 500 lpm, 50 bar, regain rotation with 70 rpm and 2.5k ft-lbs torque. Attempt to increase pump rate with pipe stalling out.  Cycle mud pumps to 400 lpm, regain rotation at 50 rpm and 2k ft-lbs torque.  Pull up into shoe at 1474m, 78 mt string weight.\n\n### Expected response 2\n\nThe drill string was stuck, but the engineer managed to release it. Because the string was not left stuck in the pipe, this is a Tight Hole scenario, not Stuck Pipe scenario.\ntighthole\n\n## Example report 3\n\nLand tree with 32 mt applied on wellhead. After wellhead connector was lowered over wellhead noticed approximately 8-10 mt drag before landing. Vent primary and secondary unlock function.  Pressure lock function with 4.1 liters and 218 bar.  Incorrect volume pumped and lock function indicator not moving.  Vent lock function and apply unlock function.  Check SVT with ROV for any indications of hitting PGB. Pick up off wellhead with slight overpull. VX ring appears OK and untouched. Align rig slightly to port.\n\n#### Expected response 3\n\nIn this report, drag and overpull relate to the surface equipment. In the Tight Hole scenario, drag and overpull relate to the drill string in the open hole. \nnotag\n\n## Example report 4\n\nJarred on string x 3 with 280 klbs pull equal to 50 klbs OP.\n\n#### Expected response 3\n\nIn this report, the drill string is stuck and the drilling engineer couldn't release it. This is not a Tight Hole scenario, this is Stuck Pipe.\nnotag\n",
