Sticky tests were performed during the flowcheck\nExtended category: lostcirculation\n\n## Example event 8\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Kickoff\nOriginal hole, Mudline 129.5 m         Category: Directional drilling, Subcategory: Sidetrack\nExtended category: other\n\n## Example event 9\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: LoggingFailure\nAT 3792 MWD LOST SIGNAL FROM GR, DENSITY         Category: Equipment failure, Subcategory: Tool or equipment failure\nExtended category: other\n\n## Example event 10\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Pack-off and stalling tendancies throughtout whole stand.\nDecision make to POOH to surface to P&A well. Activity: Backream stand from 4432 to 4400m. Formation: FarsundSiltstone Mud: Omni-flow OBM1.25\nExtended category: packoff\n\n## Example event 11\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Hole packed-off\nWorked pipe and regained circulation after 3 hrs. Pumped 100 bbl hi-vis pill and commenced wiper trip to 1484m. Activity: Drilling ahead at 1700m Formation: Undiff. Nordland / HordalandMudstone Mud: KCl Polymer WBM1.62\nExtended category: packoff\n\n## Example event 12\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Kick - shallow water flow and gas\nObserved water flow with associated gas from 800m. Killed well with mud and continued to drill with 1.20 sg. flowchecked with 1.20 sg mud. indications of gas bubbles. displaced pilot hole to 1.30 sg mud. well stable.\nExtended category: shallowgas\n\n## Example event 13\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: ShallowGas\n26may2011 pilot hole - new RES. anomaly basal S2?         Category: Hydraulics, Subcategory: Shallow gas flow\nExtended category: shallowgas\n\n## Example event 14\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Stuck pipe due to poor hole cleaning\nHigh ROP through unconsolidated sands resulted in stuck pipe. Pipe was cut and fished. Well was respudded.         Category: Wellbore stability, Subcategory: Wellbore stability\nExtended category: stuck\n\n## Example event 15\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Stuck pipe\nHole packed off and string became stuck at 2077 m whilst washing and reaming.

Category: Mechanical, Subcategory: Stuck pipe\nExtended category: stuck\n\n## Example event 16\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Tight spots\nWhen running in hole with the 20\" casing, the casing took weight and had to be washed down. Category: Hydraulics, SubCategory: Poor hole cleaning\nExtended category: tighthole\n\n## Example event 17\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Drag in Balder and Balder Tuff\nA wiper trip to theshoe had drag 2410m to 2376m (Balder, just above Balder Tuff) which reduced after working. Thereturn to TD showed drag from 2322m to 2500m (Balder Claystone & Balder Tuff from shoe to topUDC) where the drag decreased         Category: Mechanical, Subcategory: Excessive drag\nExtended category: tighthole\n\n## Example event 18\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Shallow water flow (kick)\nAfter KO and sliding from 550m MD, significant flow was observed from the well. Stable after displacing to 1.30sg WBM\nExtended category: waterflow\n\n## Example event 19\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Shallow water flow (kick)\nAfter KO and sliding from 550m MD, significant flow was observed from the well. Stable after displacing to 1.30sg WBM\nExtended category: waterflow\n\n## Example event 20\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Packoffs\nPackoffs- due to poor hole cleaning when using motor and sliding excessively         Category: Wellbore stability, Subcategory: Sloughing or packoffs\nExtended category: wellborestability\n\n## Example event 21\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Breathing\nDrill 12.25\"x10.625\" 2713-2776m, experience minor dynamic losses and ballooning effect         Category: Wellbore stability, Subcategory: Ballooning\nExtended category: wellborestability\n\n## Example event 22\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: 12 bbl gain in Active\n12 bbl gain in Active at 3299m. Flowchecked \u2013 1 bbl gain in triptank. Shut in well and observed. Opened well, no flow. Category: Hydraulics, Subcategory: Other influx or kicks\nExtended category: wellcontrol\n\n## Example event 23\nScope: Subsurface\nTitle: Hydrocarbons in Viking Gp.\nWeak to strong shows were observed on drilled cuttings and core ships (with oil odour and stains) from well 16/1-30 S in the top of the Viking Group (cores 2 and 3). Oil was also observed seeping from sidewall cores and its filter cake. The log readings and fluid gradient derived from pressure points in the Viking Group of well 16/1-30 S are hard to interpret as the sandstone is rather tight. Fluid samples taken proved both oil and water. The gas was very low throughout the reservoir section, with less than 1% recorded.. Local Lessons Learned: See FWR. Category: Other. Sub-category: Stratigraphy\nExtended category: wellcontrol\n",
